# Java-Challenge-3
Summer coding challenge for TAMUSA students

This is a Java Object Oriented Programming challenge!

## Instructions
**Wordle** is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. 

### Requirements:
**Develop a Java version of the popular word game. The game may be console- or GUI-based. A dictionary API of your choice must be utilized to GET a word from. As in the original game, users have six chances to guess the 5-letter word. You must follow the standard coloring practice of coloring letters in the correct position green, letters in the wrong position yellow, and letters not found in the word grey.**

* Basic requirements:
  1. Allow user input
  2. Depict the input in a 5 x n grid
  3. Show colors of letters
  4. Show word if not guessed
  5. Show user results win/loss
  6. Show user total wins and losses
  7. Implement API
  8. GET word from API
  9. Project must be uploaded to a public repository on GitHub
        * main 
            * should match contents in dev
            * should have a limited number of commits (best, 1 per sprint)
        * dev
  10. A stand alone .jar that allows the program to be run
        * must be posted as a release under your main respository
